#+TITLE: nand2tetris.el

[[http://melpa.org/#/nand2tetris][file:http://melpa.org/packages/nand2tetris-badge.svg]]

The aim of this package is to be best emacs tool to accompany you on your
nand2tetris journey [[https://www.coursera.org/course/nand2tetris1][in Coursera]], or the [[http://www.nand2tetris.org][Official Website for it]]. This config has been modified for DOOM emacs users.



 ~Only works on Linux/OSX...for now~ 

**  Getting Started

Set the path to your nand2tetris directory with e.g. =(setq nand2tetris-core-base-dir "~/nand2tetris")=. The original file is bugged so the add to list has to be added to `config.el` until I figure out how elisp works.

#+begin_src elisp

;; nand2tetris config
 (use-package! nand2tetris
  :init
  (setq nand2tetris-core-base-dir "~/win_e/studies_other/nand2tetris/"))

(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.hdl\\'" . nand2tetris-mode))




#+end_src



** Goodies

Using =C-c C-c= will call =nand2tetris/tests-current-hdl-elsewhere= which is the same as
running:

#+begin_src sh
    HardwareSimulator.sh FILE.tst    Starts the Hardware Simulator and runs the
                                     FILE.tst test script.  The success/failure
                                     message is printed to the command console.
#+end_src

And printing the result in the modeline, it looks like this:
